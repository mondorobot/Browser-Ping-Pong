#Mondo Developers#

Unite in a game of programming telephone. 

One developer adds a feature and passes it onto the next developer to add something. We will see what we end up with periodically and show it to the world. When it is your turn come up with a new feature for the project and implement it. The ideas should be small enough to think up and implement in a 1-2 weeks of your idol time. 

Ideas should focus on web technologies, think css3 and html5.

When you are finished with your "feature":

* Add a brief description of your change to the ChangeLog.markdown file
* Let Joe Buszkiewic know and another developer will be selected at random.
