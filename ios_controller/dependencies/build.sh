# Builds dependencies for Browser Ping Pong iOS Controller
# Creates a set of universal libraries that can be used on an iPhone and in the
# iPhone simulator. Then creates a pseudo-framework to make using boost in Xcode
# less painful.
#
# To configure the script, define:
#    BOOST_LIBS:        which libraries to build
#    BOOST_VERSION:     version number of the boost library (e.g. 1_49_0)
#    IPHONE_SDKVERSION: iPhone SDK version (e.g. 5.1)
#
# Then go get the source tar.bz of the boost you want to build, shove it in the
# same directory as this script, and run "./boost.sh". Grab a cuppa. And voila.

# The EXTRA_CPPFLAGS definition works around a thread race issue in
# shared_ptr. I encountered this historically and have not verified that
# the fix is no longer required. Without using the posix thread primitives
# an invalid compare-and-swap ARM instruction (non-thread-safe) was used for the
# shared_ptr use count causing nasty and subtle bugs.
#
# Should perhaps also consider/use instead: -BOOST_SP_USE_PTHREADS
